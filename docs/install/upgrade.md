# Manual upgrade procedure for Zeppelin

<div id="toc"></div>

Basically, newer version of Zeppelin works with previous version notebook directory and configurations.
So, copying `notebook` and `conf` directory should be enough.

## Instructions
1. Stop Zeppelin

    ```
    bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh stop
    ```

1. Copy your `notebook` and `conf` directory into a backup directory

1. Download newer version of Zeppelin and Install. See [Install page](./install.html#installation).

1. Copy backup `notebook` and `conf` directory into newer version of Zeppelin `notebook` and `conf` directory

1. Start Zeppelin

   ```
   bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start
   ```

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from Zeppelin 0.6 to 0.7

 - From 0.7, we don't use `ZEPPELIN_JAVA_OPTS` as default value of `ZEPPELIN_INTP_JAVA_OPTS` and also the same for `ZEPPELIN_MEM`/`ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM`. If user want to configure the jvm opts of interpreter process, please set `ZEPPELIN_INTP_JAVA_OPTS` and `ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM` explicitly. If you don't set `ZEPPELIN_INTP_MEM`, Zeppelin will set it to `-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m` by default.
 - Mapping from `%jdbc(prefix)` to `%prefix` is no longer available. Instead, you can use %[interpreter alias] with multiple interpreter setttings on GUI.
 - Usage of `ZEPPELIN_PORT` is not supported in ssl mode. Instead use `ZEPPELIN_SSL_PORT` to configure the ssl port. Value from `ZEPPELIN_PORT` is used only when `ZEPPELIN_SSL` is set to `false`.
 - The support on Spark 1.1.x to 1.3.x is deprecated.
 - From 0.7, we uses `pegdown` as the `markdown.parser.type` option for the `%md` interpreter. Rendered markdown might be different from what you expected
 - From 0.7 note.json format has been changed to support multiple outputs in a paragraph. Zeppelin will automatically convert old format to new format. 0.6 or lower version can read new note.json format but output will not be displayed. For the detail, see [ZEPPELIN-212](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-212) and [pullrequest](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1658).
